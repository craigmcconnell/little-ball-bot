# little-ball-bot

This is a project to build a small ball-balancing robot.  The intent is to make a smaller version of the "Rezero" robot - something that will move around on a desk.  So far, I have made a high-level dynamics and controls model in MATLAB, and I've made a driver for the IMU that I plan to use.  More MATLAB modeling to come, followed by C/C++ implementation on an MBED LPC1768.
